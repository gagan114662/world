The upper tape is precisely segmented into three distinct, equally sized parts. Each of these three segments is clearly and legibly labeled with the numeral '5'. Directly below, the lower tape is a single, continuous segment that spans the entire length of the combined upper segments, and it is boldly labeled with the numeral '15'. The entire diagram is designed for maximum clarity and simplicity, intended to be rendered within a compact 256x256 pixel space, ensuring all numbers are easily readable and the proportions of the tape segments are accurately maintained for optimal visual understanding.",
